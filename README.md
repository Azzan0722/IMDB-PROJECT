ðŸ“Œ IMDB 2024 Data Scraping and Visualizations
Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting, analyzing, and visualizing IMDb movie data for the year 2024. Using Selenium, we scrape movie details such as Name, Genre, Rating, Voting Counts, and Duration from IMDb. The data is organized by genre, saved as CSV files, merged into a single dataset, stored in an SQL database, and then analyzed and visualized using Python and Streamlit.

The final deliverable is an interactive Streamlit dashboard that allows users to explore insights, apply multiple filters, and visualize trends in the 2024 IMDb movie dataset.
